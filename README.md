# Proposal
To improve our mindset of writing well tested code, following **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment, we believe that hands on experience is the quickest way of learning how to write tests that will help guarantee quality for our apps.  
It started focusing on frontend code based on angular, because it became a great gap lacking unit testing the UIs at most of our teams, but our dojo can (and probably will) cover TDD on backend apps too!

# What's being developed
We've started an app from the ground up. It's meant to be an external layer on top of our ~~disgusting~~ time tracking app, delivering some extra features like:
- Improved UI, responsive and more pleasant for mobile
- Quicker access with better authentication
- Keep own data base to let user adjust (possible forgotten) tracks
- Report all time tracking any Month, anytime
This app is designed to serve as a good example of well tested, clean & always working project.

Later, we plan to take some "bad examples" and code tests for them, helping it evolve with better quality.

# Further Info
This repo is currently a work in progress regarding it's scope. Feel free to send us your suggestions, complains, difficulties and most importantly, communicate how you are promoting quality in your projects :+1:

## Some disclaimer about our time-tracking app
We are still discussing which code standards to follow, what tools to use, how write our test cases and so on... Be part of it contributing with your ideas!
